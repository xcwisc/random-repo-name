# X-Team 41 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

First, as a team, understand the scope of the task. Estimate the workload involved with the task. Divide work by team members based on availability and experience. Check in with each teammate throughout project to reassign tasks or help with certain parts.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Develop a shared task list. Each task has three phases: unstarted, in progress, completed. Each teammate will work on their task and update the task list as progress is made towards finishing the project.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Team members experiencing difficulties on their portion of the assignment will let the other team member know via text message. At this point, other members will work with the original teammate to work on the assignment and the remaining tasks will be reassigned.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

The team leader will make sure all deadlines are available to the group. For each task within the project, there will be a deadline designated by the group at the onset of the project. When tasks are re-assigned, deadlines will be reassessed as well. Each week the team leader will check if all deadlines have been met on time. If deadlines are not met, reassignment of tasks will happen.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

At the beginning of the project, there is a three day window in which all team members must review their assigned tasks and estimate the time required for their tasks. If there is an imbalance between team members tasks will be reassigned.
